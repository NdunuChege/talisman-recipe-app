        <li>300g marshmellows</li>
        <li>175g unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>500g Philadelphia cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>250ml thickened/whipping cream , warm</li>
        <li>3tbsp powdered gelatin + 3tbsp water</li>

        <li>3 drops blue food gel</li>

    <ul>
    <h1>Preparation Instructions</h1> 
        <li>Crush the graham crackers into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a ziplock bag and crushing with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Combine the crumbs with 150g melted butter in a bowl and mix until the texture resembles wet sand.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture into the base of a 9-inch springform pan. Use the back of a spoon or the base of a glass to compress it firmly and evenly.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the crust for 20–30 minutes to set while you prepare the filling.</li>
        <li>n a small bowl, mix 3 tbsp powdered gelatin with 3 tbsp water. Let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until it absorbs the liquid and thickens (blooms).</li>
        <li>Gently heat the bloomed gelatin in a microwave (10–15 seconds) or over a double boiler until it becomes a smooth liquid. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>n a medium saucepan, combine the 300g marshmallows and warmed thickened cream (250ml) over low heat.</li>
        <li>Stir continuously until the marshmallows completely melt and the mixture becomes smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened Philadelphia cream cheese with 175g melted butter using a hand or stand mixer until smooth and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Gradually mix in the melted marshmallow-cream mixture, ensuring everything is well combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide the cheesecake mixture into two equal portions in separate bowls.</li>
        <li>Add 5 drops of purple food gel to one bowl and 3 drops of blue food gel to the other. Adjust the color intensity by adding more drops as needed. Mix until the colors are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Retrieve the chilled crust from the fridge</li>
        <li>For a layered look, pour the purple mixture over the crust, smooth the top, and refrigerate for 15–20 minutes to set slightly. Then pour the blue mixture on top and smooth it out.</li>
        <li>For a marbled effect, alternate spoonfuls of the purple and blue mixtures on the crust and use a skewer or knife to swirl the colors together gently.</li>
        <li>Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap or foil.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least 4–6 hours or overnight until fully set and firm.</li>
        <li>Once set, carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan.</li>
        <li>Decorate the top with fresh strawberries, whipped cream, or sprinkles to complement the strawberry theme.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve chilled.</li>
    </ul>
