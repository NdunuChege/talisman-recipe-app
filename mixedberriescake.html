    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen mixed berries see note below</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternative</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1¼ cups brown rice flour</li>
        <li>½ cup potato starch</li>
        <li>¼ cup tapioca starch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. With a mixer, beat the eggs with the sugar until slightly thickened and light in color, about 5-7 minutes. The mixture should almost double in size. The eggs work as your leavening agent in this recipe, so do not skip this step. This mixture should form a ribbon when you lift the beaters out of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and vanilla; mix two more minutes. Stir in the flour until just combined. This will be a very thick batter. Add the berries and stir to mix throughout.</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter to a buttered or parchment lined 9×13 pan. (This pan is my favorite!) Use your hands to press it into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until very lightly browned and a toothpick inserted near the center of the cake comes out clean. (Mine is typically done in around 42 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Let cool completely before cutting into pieces.</li>
    </ul>
