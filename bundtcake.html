    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour (2 ½ cups): Provides structure; all-purpose flour is commonly used.</li>
        <li>Sugar (2 cups): Granulated sugar adds sweetness and helps with the cake's texture</li>
        <li>Butter (1 cup, softened): Unsalted butter offers richness and moisture</li>
        <li>Eggs (4 large): Bind the ingredients and add structure and flavor.</li>
        <li>Milk or Buttermilk (1 cup): Adds moisture; buttermilk enhances tenderness and provides a subtle tang.</li>
        <li>Baking Powder (2 teaspoons): Acts as a leavening agent to help the cake rise.</li>
        <li>Salt (½ teaspoon): Balances sweetness and enhances overall flavor.</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract (2 teaspoons): Adds a classic flavor; other extracts like almond or citrus can be used.</li>
        <li>Optional Add-ins: Lemon/orange zest, spices (e.g., cinnamon, nutmeg), chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruits
            for variety.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Preparation</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease and flour a Bundt pan thoroughly to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Mix dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy for proper aeration.</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <li>Alternate adding dry ingredients and milk to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in vanilla extract or other flavorings, ensuring the batter is smooth and well-mixed.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared Bundt pan and smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 50-60 minutes until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Cool the cake in the pan for 15-20 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Optionally, prepare a glaze with powdered sugar and milk or cream, then drizzle it over the cooled cake
            before serving.</li>
    </ol>
